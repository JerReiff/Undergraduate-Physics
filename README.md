# Undergraduate-Physics
Writeups and data from lab courses I took as an undergraduate.
This includes some Latex writeups, some analysis in Jupyter Notebooks, and some description of physics experiments.
Most of these experiments are already widely repeated and are simply confirming already known physical phenomena.
